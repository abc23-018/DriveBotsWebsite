            <div class="initiative-info">
                <h3>Streamlined Testing</h3>
                <p>Our automated license testing systems replace outdated paper exams with adaptive digital assessments. The platform features facial recognition for identity verification, AI-powered scoring that evaluates both knowledge and decision-making, and instant results - reducing wait times by 60% at partnered DMVs while maintaining rigorous testing standards.</p>

            <div class="initiative-info">
                <h3>Queue Optimization</h3>
                <p>We've developed intelligent scheduling systems that predict demand at testing centers, dynamically adjust appointment availability, and send automated reminders. This has increased testing center capacity by 35% and reduced no-show rates by 75% at pilot locations, ensuring more applicants can be processed daily without expanding physical infrastructure.</p>

            <div class="initiative-info">
                <h3>Agency Integration</h3>
                <p>Our secure API platform connects testing centers with state databases in real-time, automatically validating applicant eligibility and transmitting results. This eliminates manual data entry errors, reduces processing delays from weeks to minutes, and provides law enforcement with instant license verification - all while maintaining strict data privacy standards.</p>
